## Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with [inlyse](https://www.inlyse.com/) in any way, nor is this an official project.

This was a hobby project since I own an API key and wanted something to do to try out nw.js

It is merely a happy path implementation over the course of three days to satisfy personal thirst for knowledge.
